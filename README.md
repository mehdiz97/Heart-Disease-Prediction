# Heart Disease Prediction

## Description
Heart disease is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the world today. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is a critical
challenge in the area of clinical data analysis. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be effective in assisting in making
decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry. We have also seen ML techniques
being used in recent developments in different areas of the Internet of Things. Various studies give only a glimpse into predicting
heart disease with ML techniques. In this project, we propose a method that aims to find significant features by applying
machine learning techniques that improve the accuracy of the prediction of cardiovascular disease. The prediction model
is introduced using logistic regression techniques.
